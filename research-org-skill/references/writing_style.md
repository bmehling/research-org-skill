# Writing Style and Analytical Standards

This guide establishes the tone, style, and analytical depth expected for research reports. The goal is to produce professional, credible research that serves as authoritative reference material.

## Tone and Voice

**Professional and Analytical**
- Write from a position of informed expertise without promotional language
- Avoid being overly academic or using unnecessary jargon
- Be direct and clear—assume reader has business acumen but may not know company specifics

**Balanced and Objective**
- Present both strengths and challenges for each company
- Acknowledge areas where information is limited or uncertain
- Avoid hero worship or excessive criticism
- Ground opinions in specific evidence

**Confident but Not Promotional**
- Use precise language and specific data points rather than hedging excessively
- Don't qualify every statement with "may," "might," or "could" when evidence is clear
- Conversely, clearly distinguish between fact and analysis
- Never exaggerate achievements or capabilities

**Example of Good Tone:**
"TailorCare's founding team identified MSK care as a massive market opportunity where existing solutions were either too narrowly focused (targeting only specific interventions) or too broad (lacking the specialization needed for effective care coordination). They recognized that MSK conditions require coordinated care across multiple providers, which fee-for-service models fail to support, leading to significant variability in both costs and outcomes."

**Example of Poor Tone:**
"TailorCare brilliantly recognized that MSK care was poorly served by existing solutions. The visionary founders saw opportunity where others saw only fragmentation."

## Structure and Organization

**Lead with Most Important Information**
- Within each section, put the key insight or conclusion first
- Use subsequent paragraphs to provide supporting evidence and detail
- Don't build to a conclusion—state it and then prove it

**Use Clear Paragraph Structure**
- Topic sentence that establishes the paragraph's main point
- Supporting sentences with evidence, data, and examples
- Transition sentences that connect to the next paragraph
- Avoid dense, multi-topic paragraphs

**Create Narrative Flow**
- Move logically from one idea to the next
- Use transition phrases ("Additionally," "However," "This positioning enables," etc.)
- Connect each section to the company's overall strategy or market position
- Help the reader understand how each piece fits into the bigger picture

**Example of Good Structure:**
"TailorCare distinguishes itself through its risk-based, value-based care model. The company takes downside financial risk for patient outcomes, aligning incentives around quality and cost-effectiveness rather than volume. This positioning enables partnerships with health plans and risk-bearing entities seeking to reduce MSK-related costs while improving member satisfaction and clinical outcomes."

## Specificity and Concrete Detail

**Use Specific Data Points Over Generalizations**

Instead of: "The company has grown significantly and serves many customers"
Use: "As of July 2025, the platform was used across 10,000 hospitals and by 40% of physicians in the United States, representing 8.5 million clinical consultations per month"

**Include Quantitative Metrics**
- Use real numbers: revenue estimates, customer counts, growth rates, market shares
- When exact numbers aren't available, make reasonable estimates and clearly mark them as such
- Provide timeframes for all metrics ("as of July 2025," "in Q3 2024")
- Show growth trends: "grew from 358K consultations in July 2024 to 8.5 million monthly by July 2025, representing 2,000%+ growth"

**Provide Concrete Examples**
- For features: describe specific use cases (e.g., "A cardiologist might query the platform during patient consultation to compare two medications' efficacy and side effects using head-to-head trial data")
- For partnerships: name specific partners and explain the relationship
- For traction: reference specific logos, case studies, or customer types
- For opportunities: provide specific market size or competitive dynamics

**Cite Sources**
- Include dates and sources for claims
- Use direct quotes when they add clarity or credibility
- Provide links to source material where relevant
- When citing company claims, distinguish them from third-party validation

**Example of Specific, Well-Sourced Writing:**
"OpenEvidence achieved technical validation when its AI system became the first to score 100% on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) in August 2025. The perfect score represents a 10% improvement from the model's initial test in 2023 and validates the accuracy of OpenEvidence's platform for providing practitioners with medical information on demand."

## Depth and Rigor Standards

**Go Beyond Surface-Level Analysis**

For competition: Don't just list competitors. Analyze their positioning, strengths, and weaknesses relative to the subject company.

Instead of: "Competitor A is also in the market"
Use: "Competitor A focuses on enterprise-integrated solutions through Epic partnerships, whereas OpenEvidence pursues a direct-to-physician consumer model that bypasses lengthy hospital procurement processes. This gives OpenEvidence faster adoption among individual practitioners but limits institutional relationships."

**Understand Market Dynamics**

- Explain why customers care about specific features
- Connect company positioning to market trends and tailwinds
- Understand the unit economics and business model implications
- Analyze how regulatory or reimbursement changes affect the business

**Connect Company Capabilities to Opportunity**

- Don't just identify opportunities; explain why the company is positioned to capture them
- Consider what would need to happen for the opportunity to be realized
- Acknowledge obstacles or challenges even when discussing opportunities

**Example of Rigorous Analysis:**
"OpenEvidence's model as a standalone, free platform represents a differentiated model within the CDSS market, which has historically been dominated by enterprise solutions integrated with hospital systems. As of June 2025, the company had been registering 50K new verified U.S. clinicians each month, indicating ongoing expansion within the market for US physicians. The rapid adoption demonstrates both the unmet demand for AI-powered medical evidence and the effectiveness of a direct-to-practitioner go-to-market strategy that avoids lengthy hospital IT procurement processes."

## Tables and Lists

**Use Tables for Comparative or Structured Data**

Appropriate for:
- Funding round history (columns: Round, Date, Amount, Valuation, Lead Investors, Notes)
- Competitor comparison (columns: Company, URL, Founded, Focus, Differentiators)
- Executive team (columns: Name/Title, Background, Experience, Tenure)
- Key metrics over time (columns: Period, Metric 1, Metric 2, etc.)

**Format Guidelines:**
- Include header rows
- Keep column descriptions concise but clear
- Use consistent formatting across similar tables
- Include notes column when context is important
- Right-align numeric data, left-align text
- Never use tables as a lazy way to avoid writing analysis

**Use Lists Carefully**

- Avoid excessive bullet points—use prose paragraphs instead
- Lists are appropriate for:
  - Features or capabilities (when part of product description)
  - Key investors or board members (with context)
  - Customer segments (with brief description)
- Even in lists, each item should be 1-2 sentences with context, not just a phrase

**Example of Effective Table:**

| Round | Date | Amount Raised | Valuation | Lead Investors | Notes |
|-------|------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Seed | Q1 2020 | $2M | $10M | Angel investors | Internal funding, founder-led |
| Series A | Q3 2021 | $5M | $25M | Investor A, Investor B | Growth round, expanded team |
| Series B | Q2 2023 | $15M | ~$90M | Investor C (lead) | Estimated based on 6x ratio from Series A |

## Handling Uncertainty and Missing Information

**Be Transparent About Data Gaps**

When information isn't publicly available:
- Acknowledge the gap: "While revenue figures are not publicly disclosed..."
- Make reasonable estimates when appropriate: "...estimated to be in the $8M-$30M range based on funding size and typical healthcare software unit economics"
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and estimates

**Don't Speculate**

When you don't know something:
- Don't invent details or make unfounded assumptions
- Say "Information not publicly available" rather than guessing
- Use phrases like "Based on available information..." or "As of [date]..."

**Update Information with Caveats**

- Note when research was completed: "Research completed: December 6, 2025"
- Include "as of" dates for time-sensitive metrics
- Acknowledge that some information may have changed since research date

**Example of Transparent Uncertainty:**
"While Switchboard Health has not publicly disclosed detailed revenue or customer metrics, several indicators demonstrate market traction and growth trajectory... The ability to attract capital from healthcare-focused VCs indicates investor confidence in the company's progress and market opportunity."

## Citation and Sourcing

**Link to Sources**
- Use [company website](https://example.com) or [announcement](https://example.com) format
- Provide URLs in brackets: [link text](URL)
- Include dates when sourcing from time-sensitive material

**Quote Appropriately**
- Use direct quotes for unique insights or particularly well-stated points
- Keep quotes brief (under 30 words typically)
- Provide context after quotes to explain their relevance
- Don't over-quote; paraphrase when possible

**Example of Good Citation:**
"As founder and CEO Derek Baird describes it: 'There's a huge opportunity to do better [in specialty care coordination].' This insight directly informs Switchboard's patient-first approach to solving referral workflow challenges."

**Attribute Claims**
- Third-party data: cite the source (e.g., "According to a 2024 Gartner study...")
- Company claims: identify them as such (e.g., "The company claims to serve...")
- Published research: include authors or publication names

## Comparative Analysis and Positioning

**Understand What Makes Companies Different**

When discussing competitors:
- Identify dimensions of differentiation (go-to-market, technology, pricing, customer segment, etc.)
- Explain why the difference matters for the specific market
- Avoid value judgments ("better" or "worse") without context

**Example of Good Competitive Analysis:**
"Glass Health's product allows physicians to input patient case information and receive AI-generated differentials, workup plans, and evidence summaries for potential diagnoses. Unlike OpenEvidence's broad Q&A approach, Glass Health emphasizes diagnostic AI with a more case-centric focus, while OpenEvidence is question-centric. This distinction affects customer use cases: Glass Health targets diagnosticians seeking help with differential reasoning, while OpenEvidence serves broader clinical decision support needs."

**Connect to Market Dynamics**

- Explain how competitive positioning relates to market size and growth
- Discuss how different strategies can coexist in large markets
- Consider how competition may evolve

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Avoid Promotional Language**
- Don't use words like "innovative," "revolutionary," "game-changing" without substantiation
- Let the facts speak for themselves
- Use these words only when competitors or markets lack similar capabilities

**Avoid Hedging Excessively**
- "It appears to seem that the company might possibly..." is not professional
- Balance certainty with accuracy
- Use "The company claims," "Available data suggests," or "This positioning enables" appropriately

**Avoid Inconsistency**
- Keep metrics and terminology consistent throughout
- If you call a company "early-stage" in one section, don't call it "mature" in another
- Use consistent naming conventions for products, customers, etc.

**Avoid Vagueness**
- Specific beats generic every time
- Instead of "The company operates in multiple markets," say "The company operates in Medicare Advantage, commercial health plan, and employer segments"
- Instead of "The platform integrates with major EMRs," name which EMRs (Epic, Cerner, etc.)
