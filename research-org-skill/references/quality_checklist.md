# Quality Guide

This guide details the quality checklist for research entries. Review and check the report against the checklist to ensure it meets the quality standards.

## Before creating the database entry:

### General Checks
✓ All claims are supported by evidence and source links are included 
✓ Writing styles are consistent with writing style guidelines

### Sections 
✓ All sections are present and complete
✓ Sections are in the correct order

### Funding and Valuation Checks
✓ Each funding round has a clear valuation (or is listed as estimated if ratio method used or not available if not enough data was available)
✓ A summary of funding and valuation is provided per references/section_guidelines.md

### Category Consistency Checks
✓ At least one category selected
✓ Categories are based on explicit product features mentioned in research
✓ Categories are consistent with similar companies in database
✓ No more than 4-5 categories (more becomes less useful)
✓ Primary category clearly reflects main offering

## After the database entry is created:

### Check the Notion page and database entry
✓ The report was created
✓ The report is complete (all sections and content are present)
✓ The database entry includes the intended Industries, Categories, Revenue, Stage, and FTE entries
