# Category Selection

This guide helps identify appropriate database Categories and Industries for research entries.

## Category Selection Strategy

### Overview

The Solutions & Vendors database includes 85+ category options. Effective category selection requires reading the company's product descriptions, understanding their positioning, and identifying which categories best describe their offerings and approach.

**Key Principle:** Multiple categories are encouraged when accurate. It's better to over-categorize than under-categorize, but selections should be defensible based on the research.

### Category Selection Workflow

**Step 1: Extract Keywords from Research**

While reading/researching the company, highlight keywords that map to Categories:

- **AI-related:** "AI", "machine learning", "generative AI", "LLM", "neural", "intelligent"
  - Maps to: **AI**, **Agentic**, **Ambient Notes** (if AI monitoring/notes)

- **Voice/Communication:** "voice", "call", "conversation", "speech", "audio", "phone"
  - Maps to: **Voice**, **Real-time** (if real-time guidance)

- **Automation/Workflow:** "automation", "workflow", "process", "RPA", "orchestration"
  - Maps to: **Workflow Automation**, **Orchestration Platform**, **BPM**

- **Analytics/Insights:** "analytics", "insights", "reporting", "dashboard", "metrics", "data"
  - Maps to: **Analytics**, **Revenue Analytics**, **Healthcare Analytics**, **Data**

- **Real-time:** "real-time", "instant", "immediate", "live", "streaming"
  - Maps to: **Real-time**, **Revenue Analytics** (if revenue-focused)

- **Security/Compliance:** "security", "privacy", "compliance", "HIPAA", "encrypted"
  - Maps to: **Security**, **InfoSec**, **Threat Intelligence**

**Step 2: Map Keywords to Specific Categories**

Using the keyword mappings above, convert identified keywords into specific Category selections.

**Example: Cresta**
- Product: "AI-powered contact center platform with real-time coaching for agents"
- Keywords identified: "AI", "real-time", "coaching", "conversation intelligence", "voice", "automation"
- Categories selected: **AI** (primary), **Voice** (real-time voice guidance), **Agentic** (virtual agent capability)

**Step 3: Validate Against Similar Companies**

Before finalizing Categories:
1. Find similar companies already in the database
2. Review their Category selections
3. Ensure consistency (similar products should have similar Category patterns)
4. Note any differences and justify if company is truly positioned differently

**Step 4: Consider Secondary/Tertiary Categories**

After selecting primary categories, ask: "What other aspects of this company's offering are important?"

- Primary: What is the company's main offering?
- Secondary: What complementary capabilities exist?
- Tertiary: What adjacent markets does it serve?

Example: A voice AI platform might be:
- Primary: **Voice**
- Secondary: **AI**, **Real-time**
- Tertiary: **Analytics** (if it includes call analytics), **Workflow Automation** (if it automates workflows)

### Industry Selection Workflow

**Multi-Vertical Companies**
If a company serves multiple distinct verticals (e.g., both Healthcare AND Financial Services), use both Industry options to enable filtering by vertical.

**Horizontal vs. Vertical Focus**
The **Industry** field (Healthcare, Horizontal, Legal, etc.) captures vertical focus. Categories should reflect product type, not industry focus. A horizontal platform used in healthcare should have **Industry: Healthcare** but categories reflecting what it does (e.g., **AI**, **Data**), not who uses it.

**Emerging Categories & Industries**
If a company doesn't fit existing options well:
1. Use the closest existing option
2. Note in the Field Preview any recommended additional options for Industries and Categories

### Category Consistency Checks

Before publishing research, verify:
- ✓ At least one category selected
- ✓ Categories are based on explicit product features mentioned in research
- ✓ Categories are consistent with similar companies in database
- ✓ No more than 4 categories (more becomes less useful)
- ✓ Primary category clearly reflects main offering
